The following is a descriptive list of the requirements to test all the codes in the book:

Hardware: 64-bit machine with minimum 2 GB of RAM 
(4 GB preferred) and at least 5 GB of free disk  
space.
Software: JDK 8, Git, Maven, Payara Micro Server, 
Docker, Node, npm, Angular CLI
Oracle JDK 8: All the codes are tested on Oracle 
JDK 8, but OpenJDK should work fine as well
Docker: Docker CE and Docker Compose
More details: Latest version of Git and Maven   
(Apache Maven 3.5 or above), Payara Micro 5 
(https://www.payara.fish/downloads)
The book is being written considering Java EE 8 and
 Payara. But a compatible/stable version of Payara 
for the latest EE 8, hasn't been released yet. So 
the code has been verified against Payara Micro 5 
Alpha releases
